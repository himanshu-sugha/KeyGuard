## Key Features
### Secure EdDSA Key Pair Generation
Create cryptographically secure key pairs with ease.

### Message Signing with EdDSA
Sign messages for A-MACI operations directly within the tool.

### Encrypted Private Key Storage
AES-encrypted storage ensures your private keys remain secure.

### Key Labeling and Organization
Add labels to your keys for easy identification and organization.

### Easy Key and Signature Copying
Seamlessly copy keys and signatures with one click.

### Import/Export Key Backup
Safely back up your keys with encrypted export/import functionality.

### Signature Verification
Verify EdDSA signatures for secure operations.

### Password-Protected Storage
Safeguard your key management with password protection.

### Responsive Design
Optimized for use across devicesâ€”desktop, tablet, and mobile.

## Why A-MACI?
A-MACI revolutionizes decentralized governance by providing:
- **Privacy Protection**: Ensures trustless, anonymous voting using zk-SNARK/PLONK.
- **Anti-Collusion Measures**: Prevents voters from verifying their votes to eliminate collusion.
- **Operator Independence**: Voting details remain private, even from administrators.

Our tool enhances the A-MACI experience by giving users secure and intuitive control over their cryptographic keys.

## How It Works
1. **Generate Keys**: Create EdDSA key pairs for unique identification in A-MACI.
2. **Encrypt & Store**: Private keys are securely stored using AES encryption.
3. **Sign & Verify**: Sign necessary messages for A-MACI voting and verify signatures.
4. **Manage & Organize**: Label and organize keys, and back them up securely.
