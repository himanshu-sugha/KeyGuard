## Why A-MACI?

A-MACI revolutionizes decentralized governance by providing:
- **Privacy Protection**: Ensures trustless, anonymous voting using zk-SNARK/PLONK.
- **Anti-Collusion Measures**: Prevents voters from verifying their votes to eliminate collusion.
- **Operator Independence**: Voting details remain private, even from administrators.

Our tool enhances the A-MACI experience by giving users secure and intuitive control over their cryptographic keys.

## How It Works
1. **Generate Keys**: Create EdDSA key pairs for unique identification in A-MACI.
2. **Encrypt & Store**: Private keys are securely stored using AES encryption.
3. **Sign & Verify**: Sign necessary messages for A-MACI voting and verify signatures.
4. **Manage & Organize**: Label and organize keys, and back them up securely.
